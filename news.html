			<p>The Japanese brand was late to the EV party but plans a dramatic expansion in models and innovative battery technology; it's planning to sell 3.5 million EVs annually across 30 different Toyota and Lexus model lines by 2030.</p>
			<p>Long-range battery packs will provide up to 500 miles of range by 2026 and 620 miles by 2027.</p>
			<p>Toyota is aiming to introduce solid-state batteries in 2027, which will be capable of ultra-fast 10 minute recharge times from 10 to 80 percent state of charge.</p>
			<p>Toyota recently announced it had passed the benchmark of having built more than 300 million cars since the company was founded 88 years ago. But despite having pioneered hybrid powertrains, the company's high-level skepticism towards EVs means that very few of those cars have been fully electric; the Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ450e have only gone on sale in the last year. It is one of the last major automakers to enter the EV space.</p>

			<p>Auto startup Callum has revealed images and specs of an electric off-roader named the Skye.</p>
			<p>The Skye will weigh around 2600 pounds, built on a space-frame chassis with 13.7 inches of ground clearance, and offer about 170 miles of range between charges.</p>
			<p>The company says it will have "curated variants" ready for Europe in spring 2024. Whether it comes to the U.S. is still an open question.</p>
			<p>The Skye's space frame will use carbon-fiber links between metal joining sections, with Donfrancesco confirming that it is unique to Callum and not shared with any other manufacturer. Bodywork will be made from lightweight composite material. Suspension will be fully independent, with two different articulation options to allow buyers to choose more or less ground clearance.</p>

			<p>After two brutal months of posturing, negotiations, and work stoppages designed to inflict maximum pain, the 2023 United Auto Workers (UAW) strike against Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis has finally ended.</p>
			<p>UAW president Shawn Fain first announced a tentative agreement with Ford on October 25. Stellantis followed suit a few days later, followed finally by General Motors on October 30. With UAW members voting to accept the deals last week, the strike is now officially over. At 46 days, it is the longest UAW action since 1998's strike against GM.</p>
			<p>The Ford contract cleared first, with 69 percent of workers voting in favor of the agreement. Stellantis bettered that with 70 percent voting in favor, but GM's barely passed. Just 55 percent voted in favor.</p>

			<p>Bugatti redefines automotive norms, where nothing about their modern marvels is ordinary, and their hypercars move at speeds that surpass most. From the groundbreaking Veyron, effortlessly cruising past 400km/h, to the historic moment when the Chiron became the world's first production car to exceed 300mph at Volkswagen’s Ehra-Lessien test track in August 2019—Bugatti's legacy is one of unparalleled speed and innovation.</p>
			<p>For many automakers, achieving such milestones would be the pinnacle, a mission accomplished. </p>
			<p>Bugatti's upcoming track-only hypercar is a testament to the brand's commitment to pushing the limits of what's possible. As the engineering minds behind Bugatti throw the conventional rules of the road out the window, their pursuit of automotive excellence takes a daring turn. The hypercar, as revealed in the latest details, is set to defy expectations and redefine the boundaries of automotive insanity.</p>

			<p>Building a Cybertruck is no easy feat, a challenge both recognized by the creator of this wooden Tesla Cybertruck and Elon Musk himself. While Tesla has spent years refining the Cybertruck's stainless-steel body, someone managed to craft a wooden version in just 100 days.</p>
			<p>Despite Tesla nearing production, Elon Musk and the team are still fine-tuning. What sets this wooden masterpiece apart is not just its rapid creation but its functionality—a fully drivable Tesla Cybertruck with a body crafted from wood.  </p>

			<p>For the last quarter-century, devoted Mazda enthusiasts in Southern California have eagerly anticipated an annual gathering dedicated to honoring the iconic rotary engine. Over the years, the fervor and engagement surrounding Sevenstock have only intensified. This yearly event is orchestrated by the Southern California RX Club with Mazda's backing. Initially held at Mazda's facilities in Irvine, California, the event outgrew its original location due to an increasing number of cars and attendees.</p>
			<p>By 2010, recognizing the burgeoning size of the event's following, Sevenstock made a significant transition to a larger venue to accommodate its enthusiastic fan base. Irwindale Speedway, with its expansive space, became the new host for this celebration, providing ample room for hundreds of cars and thousands of fans. This relocation was pivotal for the grand 25th-anniversary milestone of Sevenstock.</p>

			<p>Long before Michael Barr received his R32 Skyline GT-R, he had already constructed it multiple times in his mind. Like many enthusiasts, owning one seemed like a distant dream initially. However, as Japan's finest vehicles gradually made their way to the U.S. over the years, opportunities to obtain these coveted machines became more feasible. Michael recalls, "When importation became a possibility, I meticulously planned the purchase two years in advance. This included acquiring a daily driver, anticipating that I wouldn't want to use the Skyline GT-R for everyday commuting."</p>
			<p>In the midst of 2018, an entirely stock R32 was located and brought in, marking the beginning of the modification journey. The initial significant change was a bold one. "I was set on painting it TV2 Bayside Blue from the R34 GT-R," he mentions. "The build's ethos was to embrace the late '90s JDM tuning aesthetic prevalent in Japan, relying on authentic Japanese brands, primarily HKS and Nismo."</p>
